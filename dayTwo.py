# Printing Practice Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console. The text to print is already there,
#  you just need to make it into code. Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below. Make sure that you don't 
# change any of these existing text as everything, punctuation and casing all need to match!
# 
# print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
# print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
# print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
# print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
# print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")

# print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.\n 2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.\n 3. Add 3g of Salt.\n4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.\n5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")

# print("Hello " + "Todd")

# Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

# print("Notes from Day 1")
# print("The print statement is used to output strings")
# print("Strings are strings of characters")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
# print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")

# input("What is your name")

# print("Hello " + input("What is your name ") + "!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(len(("Hello " + name)))
